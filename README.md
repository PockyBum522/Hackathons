## 2022-TadHack-JMA-JDS

This python project is intended to demo a personal assistant app that takes phone call audio using the Jambonz API and then asks the Google text to speech API for text from that call. 

The intended use case is for a person running a business who calls their clients to set up appointments. They would call this application's phone number, then merge in their customer.

Further improvements would use NLP to recognize key events in the conversation, such as the customer relaying their contact information. This application would then offer to make a contact on the user's phone. Other helpful features could recognize appointments being made, and then this application could create an event for that on the user's calendar.

* Trouble getting set up with Jambonz API in python/documentation errors led to us running their demo in Node.js and working backwards from there. Documentation errors were reported to Jambonz so they could be fixed.

This demo shows an application that allows users with tablets to collaborate with each other as if they were sitting around a shared piece of paper. This enables quick note taking that everyone can work on or add to, or marking up an image or drawing to quickly sketch and show the other users something you're trying to convey.

## 2021-TadHack-JMA-JDS

This demo shows an application that can take user input via SMS and offer to help the user in a museum. Assistance offered could be instructions on how to find something, more detailed information about an exhibit, or signing up for a tour.

* This was my first time using Node.js, and I learned a lot.
